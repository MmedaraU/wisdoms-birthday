# Brief Introduction

This project is meant as a birthday card to a friend of mine. We haven't met in a while and I couldn't make it to see him on his birthday.

Also, I'm fairly new to coding and I'm taking every opportunity to practice. 

This is a pretty rudimentary site. Hopefully as I learn, I can add on to it.


# Technologies Used
1. Sass
2. CSS Flexbox
