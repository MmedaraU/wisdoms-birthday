            Dear Wisdom,<br>
            I wanted to get you a card but I didn't think I'd be able to get it to you so I wrote this down.
          </p>
          <p>My love, we've been friends for a while now and I can gladly say you're one of the best friends I have. You
            are one of the most genuine people I know and I love you immensely.</p>

          <p>I still think it's crazy how we go for lengths of time without talking but when we do talk again, its just
            normal. It not like we're catching up, it feels like we're just continuing a conversation.</p>

          <p>You always have a way of encouraging me when I'm down and making me feel like things aren't so bad.</p>

          <p>I love that I've got to experience and see you grow and it's been really amazing.</p>

          <p>You have a devotion to the things of God that can't be faked and that has been an inspiration to me
            probably
            more than you'll know. Thank you for your support and your love and
            your friendship and for being who you are.</p>

          <p>I pray for many more years of God's favour, grace and love. God bless you!</p>
